Nancy Drew was caught in the trap laid by some smugglers and it was then when I felt a light tap on my bent head. The teacher had caught me red handed.

The saddest day of my life was the Diwali Day. Diwali is considered to be a happy festival and till last Diwali, it was my favorite festival. On last Diwali, my sister, my brother and I were busy lighting the fireworks. I was holding a fuljhari in my hand and unfortunately my younger brother, who was standing just beside me, had a cracker in his hand. This cracker caught fire and a very loud explosion was heard which shook my sister and me. After that, we all could think of nothing else than blood stained cotton, bandage, dettol, etc. My cousin took my brother to the doctor where he got 14 stitches in his forefinger and thumb. But at home, everybody kept cursing and blaming me for the mishap. That night, I could not sleep and I cried a lot.

He should not miss the pleasure locked in the classics, poetry, drama, history, philosophy etc. We can derive benefit from otherâ€™s experiences with the help of books. The various sufferings, endurance and joy described in books enable us to have a closer look at human life. They also inspire us to face the hardships of life courageously. Nowadays there are innumerable books and time is scarce. So we should read only the best and the greatest among them. With the help of books we shall be able to make our thinking mature and our life more meaningful and worthwhile.");

First of all, I visited the general section of the exhibition where different charts and photographs depicting Indias development in various fields were set. Most impressive photographs among these were those showing Indias nuclear development. The second section dealt with Indias magnificent historical background. I was fascinated by the pictures of Mohanjodaro excavation. Then I saw the most beautiful and colorful section of the exhibition i.e. the cultural section. It consisted of paintings, sculptures, photographs etc. The Rajasthani and Gujarati paintings were very colourful and attractive. This exhibition, inaugurated by the Prime Minister, lasted for a week. It proved to be of great educational value. It brushed up my knowledge about India as my motherland. It enhanced my respect for my great country, India. I would very much appreciate if the Indian government organized some more such exhibitions.");

If you are in one of the run-down older theaters, you must adjust to the musty smell of seldom-cleaned carpets. Escaped springs lurk in the faded plush or cracked leather seats, and half the seats you sit in seem loose or tilted so that you sit at a strange angle. The newer twin and quad theaters offer their own problems. Sitting in an area only one-quarter the size of a regular theater, moviegoers often have to put up with the sound of the movie next door. This is especially jarring when the other movie involves racing cars or a karate war and you are trying to enjoy a quiet love story. And whether the theater is old or new, it will have floors that seem to be coated with rubber cement. By the end of a movie, shoes almost have to be pried off the floor because they have become sealed to a deadly compound of spilled soda, hardening bubble gum, and crushed Ju-Jubes.");

Adults act as if they were at home in their own living rooms and comment loudly on the ages of the stars or why movies aren't as good anymore. And people of all ages crinkle candy wrappers, stick gum on their seats, and drop popcorn tubs or cups of crushed ice and soda on the floor. They also cough and burp, squirm endlessly in their seats, file out for repeated trips to the rest rooms or concession stand, and elbow you out of the armrest on either side of your seat.");

Leaving a home equipped with a TV and a video recorder isn't an attractive idea on a humid, cold, or rainy night.

        paragraphs.add("'Why both Sartre and Camus should have been so keenly aware of the absurd about the same time is one of those mysteries of the zeitgeist time spirit: that we are still far from solving. Camus always had a strongly lyrical feeling for the material world-sunlight, sea, saw- so that his consciousness of the absurd was an intermittent feeling, occurring only in moments of metaphysical interrogation. Also, as he came from the working classs, he did not look upon it so much as a social stratum but rather as a highly differentiated reality, made up of irreducible individuals. In other words, his intellectualism, which was genuine and had moreover been developed by philosophical studies at the university level, was tempered by pragmatism and a sense of inarticualate values. Poverty, tuberculosis, and a feeling for human solidarity made him much more of an ordinary man than Sartre, the ferociously dedicated intellectual, whose professed aim is to translate everything into words, so that formulated truths can react on society.
